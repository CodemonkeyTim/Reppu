ReppuApp - To make Reppu browsing a bit easier (as impossible as it sounds!)

Basic build:

1. Clone / fork the repo
2. Create new app to PhoneGap Build (build.phonegap.com)
3. Build the app
4. Install from QR code / Download the apk

Notes:

- App was made in ~10h, with the base made in ~5h. Which is to say it's very immature
- Basic idea of the app was to show information from Reppu and to be able to download files.
- If you have the will and skill to improve the app to be able to handle all of the Reppu's functions (and all the quirks...), feel free to do so.
- All of this crap is free to use, modify and develop further.
